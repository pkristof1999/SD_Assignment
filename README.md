<h1 style="text-align: center;">Homework Project (Game #2.26)</h1>

<hr>
<p>In this game, there are two kings on a board.</p>
<p>The rules are simple:</p>
    <li>The player with the White King starts, and after each step,
        the player deletes a tile.</li>
    <li>A player wins the game, if the other player can't move anymore.</li>

<hr>

<h3>The game consists of three main scenes.</h3>

<p>The first is the start scene, where the
players can give their names, and choose their color.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 5em;">
    <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/StartUI.png" alt="StartUI"/>
</div>

<p>On the second and main scene, you can see the board, where the players can move
their pieces, and delete tiles until one of them can't move anymore.</p>

</div>

<p>And on the third scene, you can check the leaderboard. There is also a refresh
button, so it can be kept open while playing, and refresh it after someone wins.</p>
